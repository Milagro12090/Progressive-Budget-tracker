# PWA_Budget_Tracker

# Description

This is my first PWA project. It was somewhat challenging I am still having issues with atlas working on the deployed application but if you install and run on a local host it should work fine.

# Usage

This is a simple budget tracker where the user can add and delete items to there budget and the app will display a corresponding graph to show you how you are spending money. This will also work in offline mode just incase you dont have internet

# Tech Used

- Node.js
